# OLX-Sales-Forecast
This is a forecast of OLX store sales based on the arbitrary data set of 45 OLX stores, which is itself modelled on the Wallmart Stores sale data set available on Kaggle.



!!!!Notice that as I couldn't find a concrete and an accurate data set of Eid or other religious holidays in Pakistan so I had to use Christmas and Thanks Giving Holidays data which I copied raw from a kaggle challenge, you can try try manipulating and playing around with these data sets and can infringe and reuse this model as I am not adding any copyrights or licences.....


<h2>Description: </h2>
This solution falls under the 8th UNSDG of "Decent Work and Economic Growth". The dataset is taken from [Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-sales-forecasting/data/). I made use of multiple prediction alogarithms and models including Auto Regression Model, Moving Average Model, Auto Regression Moving Average Model, Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average Model, Seasonal-ARMA Model and Random Forest Regression Model.

<h2>Facbook Prophet: </h2>
Facebook Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool in Python and R released and managed by Facebook. I made use of Facebook Prophet at the end of this project to forecast weekly, daily, quarterly and yearly sales of all the arbitrary OLX stores. 

<h2>How to use: </h2>
Open the Interactive Python Notebook, and scroll down to the model/alogairthm implementation part if you want to skip data exploration and visualization. Each alogarithm is implmented by either importing it or hardcoding the logic. Each alogarithm's predictions and results are visulaized using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

<h2>How is this a solution ? </h2>
The question remains, How is this a solution to the problem of economic growth?
The answser lies in the ipynb file, I used this piece of code to predict the sales of hypothetical stores, you can fine tune and tweak this file to predict the sales of any online/take away store of any business domain in any region of the world.

<h2>What will you need ? </h2>
1. Dataset: You need your own dataset of the desired domain to use this file, if you don't have one, try searching it up on Kaggle.
2. Editor and Compiler: Once you are done with the dateset part, adjust the features acordingly and let the snippet do its job. Run all the code in compiler and hopefully it will forecast the  sales of your store.

<h2>Where can I use this solution ?</h2>
You can use this forecasting approach if you are starting a new business of your own, investing in an already running business or looking to explore multiple business domain.

<h2>Risk Analysis: </h2>
Risk analysis is a Data Scientist's main job. Businesses, companies, corporates, big tech firms, all make use of this technique before any financial investment and this solution provides just that. It's a successful implementation of many of the tech world's most widely used regression models.
